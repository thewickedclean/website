    <h2 class="text-center">What are some of the benefits of a ceramic coating?</h2>
    <p>No need to wax or seal the vehicle for the life of the coating. Ceramic coatings create a barrier that is significantly harder, more chemical resistant, and longer lasting than any wax or sealant. Adding any products "on top" of a coating other than maintenance products sold by the coating manufacturer can impede a coatings protective abilities.</p>
    <p>Reduce the amount of cleaning needed, makes cleaning the vehicle easier. Dirt releases easier, faster, and the resulting effect is much less time and effort needed to make your vehicle look like it has been freshly detailed.</p>
    <p>Marring resistance. While NOTHING is "scratch proof" some professional grade coatings do make the surface harder than original clear coat, thus greatly reducing the amount of swirl marks accumulated over time vs. a non-ceramic coated vehicle with proper washing and drying techniques.</p>
    <p>Excellent gloss and aesthetic appeal. Clients have told us that even years after having their vehicle ceramic coated, they still get compliments about the car having a "just detailed look" after a simple wash.</p>
    <p>UV and chemical protection. Ceramic coatings provide protection against harmful UV rays and chemicals far beyond any wax or sealant. Most professional grade coatings are very chemical resistant and can only be damaged or removed by extremely high or low PH products.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">How do I take care of a ceramic coating after it is applied?</h2>
    <p>This simplest answer to this question is to wash it, then dry it completely, and take it to your detailer as needed for decontamination or maintenance. Maintenance from a detailer may consistent of high PH washing to deep clean the coating, chemical decontamination with iron removal chemicals, clay bar treatment, maintenance products meant to reinvigorate or increase slickness, or even spot polishing and recoating of small sections in case of damage. Wicked Clean provides maintenance services to ensure your ceramic coated vehicle is as fresh as the day it was ceramic coated.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">My car is brand new. Will I still need to have the paint clayed and polished prior to coating application?</h2>
    <p>Yes, any quality detailer will see these steps as the foundation necessary for a quality ceramic coating application. Any detailer or dealership that does not follow these steps prior to applying a ceramic coating are likely improperly applying the coating. Even for a brand-new vehicle &ldquo;off the truck&rdquo; thorough wash, clay bar treatment, and light polishing are the absolute minimum before coating application. Often times much more polishing and compounding is needed even on a brand-new vehicle to make sure the surface is as flawless as possible before the ceramic coating is applied. Wicked Clean uses new tools, such as clay and polishing pads with every ceramic coating service.</p>
