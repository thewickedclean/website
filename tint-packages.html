    <h2>Why Tint Your Cars Window?</h2>
    <p>
      Window tinting refers to the process of applying a thin laminate film to a vehicle's glass in order to darken it. The reasons people choose to tint the windows of an automobile vary. These might include privacy or security; protection from UV rays including UVA, the ones responsible for causing skin cancer; and reducing solar gain (interior heat) and thus incrementally improving fuel economy; and cutting down on glare from the sun. Of course, there are purely aesthetic reasons as well for applying car window tint. It doesn't hurt that some people think that tinted car windows look cool, like celeb-style sunglasses for your car.

    <h2>Window Tint: Pros & Cons?</h2>
    <p>
      So you’re at the point where you want to add more character to your car. You want it to stand out and reflect your style without being too overpowering — but you also want it to benefit you in the best ways possible. You’ve probably seen several different versions of window tints ranging from light shades to pitch-black.
    </p>
    <h2>A dark tint may look impressive, but is tinting safe?</h2>
    <p>
      While the immediate answer is “Yes,” some situations are dangerous to drivers, pedestrians and other motorists. A potential downfall of using tints on your car’s windows is installing too dark a shade. Going a little overboard can get you in trouble with the law as well as from potential hazards while driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know tints offer a ton of benefits and also give you the perfect aesthetic when customizing your ride — which is perfect! Tints can block UV rays, offer privacy, reduce glare and provide several other positive improvements.

    <p>
      But when you install lower percentages than allowed, the dangers of dark window tints become more apparent.
