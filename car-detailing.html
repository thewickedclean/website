<h3 class="text-center">Wax vs. Ceramic Coating</h3>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col col-md-10">
    <p>
      Wax vs. ceramic coating, which is the better alternative and what is the difference. These are questions that are commonly asked when it comes to the auto detailing industry. It makes sense that there is a lot of confusion around this topic, especially since these two can be used together to keep your vehicle’s exterior protected. First, let’s cover what wax is and what it’s used for.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-center">What is Wax?</h3>
    <p>
      Wax is used as a protective barrier between your vehicle’s paint and the environmental conditions. The most common types of waxes used in the industry are montane, paraffin, and carnauba. These are typically blended with solvents to make it easier to apply onto your vehicle’s exterior. On average, wax can offer protection to your vehicle for as long as three to five weeks. However, some waxes can offer protection in the range of four to six months.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-center">What is Ceramic Coating?</h3>
    <p>
      Ceramic Coating is becoming increasingly popular as technology continues to advance. Ceramic coating differs from wax greatly. Once the ceramic coating is cured, it creates a chemical bond on the surface it is applied to. It offers a great resistance to soaps, water, and various environmental conditions. Ceramic coatings are much more durable than wax, as they resist heat, UV rays, and harsh detergents. While wax could come off at the local car wash or with a high-pressure washer, ceramic coatings will not. Some ceramic coatings can last anywhere from two to five years, while some professional coatings can last the lifetime of the car.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-center">Wax vs. Ceramic Coating: Which Is the Better Solution?</h3>
    <p>
      Is ceramic coating better than wax? Well, it depends on what you want to accomplish. If you want temporary protection and don’t mind having to consistently reapply wax to your vehicle’s exterior to keep it protected, then wax could be the option for you. Additionally, wax is a cheaper alternative. However, ceramic coating can offer your vehicle lifelong protection. If your budget allows for it, ceramic coating offers better protection, lasts longer, and eliminates the hassle of reapplying. When it comes wax vs. ceramic coating, ceramic coating provides more benefits.
