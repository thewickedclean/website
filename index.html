    <h3 class="text-center">Chris's Journey</h3>
    <p>
      Hey there, I'm Chris, and I proudly call Alpharetta, Georgia, my home. From a
      young age, my fascination with cars and their aesthetics has been a driving
      force in my life. Over the years, I've honed my skills in car detailing, delighting
      friends and family with my meticulous work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the demand for high-quality detailing services continued to rise, I saw an
      opportunity to turn my passion into a business venture. In September 2020, I took
      the leap and opened Wicked Clean in Bettendorf, Iowa. The response was overwhelmingly
      positive, with customers appreciating the attention to detail and personalized
      service we offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as life sometimes dictates, circumstances led me to make the tough decision
      to close Wicked Clean in 2022 and relocate to Georgia. Despite the challenges, I saw
      it as an opportunity for growth and a chance to bring my expertise to a new market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, settled in Alpharetta, I'm thrilled to be relaunching Wicked Clean in my new
      community. With a fresh perspective and the same dedication to excellence, I'm
      excited to continue providing top-notch detailing services to car enthusiasts in
      the area. My goal is not just to meet but to exceed the expectations of every
      customer who walks through our doors.
